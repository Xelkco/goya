        Francisco José de Goya y Lucientes (1746–1828) is regarded as the most
        important Spanish artist of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth
        centuries. Over the course of his long career, Goya moved from jolly and
        lighthearted to deeply pessimistic and searching in his paintings,
        drawings, etchings, and frescoes. Born in Fuendetodos, he later moved
        with his parents to Zaragoza and, at age fourteen, began studying with
        the painter José Luzán Martínez (1710–1785). In 1746, the year of Goya’s
        birth, the Spanish crown was under the rule of Ferdinand VI.
        Subsequently, the Bourbon king Charles III (r. 1759–88) ruled the
        country as an enlightened monarch sympathetic to change, employing
        ministers who supported radical economic, industrial, and agricultural
        reform. Goya came to artistic maturity during this age of enlightenment.
        In Madrid, the painter brothers Francisco (1734–1795) and Ramón Bayeu y
        Subías (1744–1793) had set up shop in 1763, and Goya soon joined their
        studio, eventually marrying their sister Josefa. He visited Italy in
        1770, after two failed attempts in drawing competitions at the Real
        Academia des Bellas Artes in San Fernando.

        Goya shows us a scene based on a satirical play first performed in 1698:
        The Forcibly Bewitched. The priest, Don Camillo, is being frightened
        into marriage with Doña Leonora. He’s been made to believe that a slave,
        Lucia, has bewitched him, and that his life will last only as long as
        the lamp in her room remains alight.We see Camillo eagerly replenishing
        the oil in the lamp, which is in the form of an almost life-size ram.
        The inscription in the bottom right contains the first part of two
        words, lampara descomunal (‘monstrous lamp’) – the words that the
        fearful and superstitious Camillo cries out loud.A grotesque painting of
        dancing donkeys decorates the wall behind, adding to the general air of
        mystery and sorcery. But the play is a comedy, and the hero’s
        exaggerated pose and staring eyes are intended to make us laugh at his
        gullibility.
